\chapter{DATA ANALYSIS}
\label{chap:dataAnalysis}
We care about two things:
1. The absolute cross-section of the ground state transition
2. Setting a limit on excited 0+ state cross-sections

error calculations: its own section?

\section{Detector Efficiency}

deuterium, Mg, cuts

\section{Experimental Parameters Related to the Cross Section}
current, tgt thickness (RBS), solid angle, dead time
go ahead and discuss errors while you discuss these quantities

\section{Background Subtraction}

two data sets
- pulse selection
- no pulse selection

background
- gamma peaks - do not overlap with neutron peak
- other neutron peaks - ??
- randoms - background in both data sets
- continuum - more important in non-pulse-selected data

extracting counts 
- pulse selection
- no pulse selection

The data sets for this analysis were gathered in two seperate runs; the pulse selector was not working for part of the first run.  Analysis of the datasets taken with pulse selection is straigtforward and will be discussed first.  Without pulse selection, the neutron peak sits on top of background from previous neutron bunches.  The background fit is different and the total counts have a larger systematic uncertainty; extracting these will be discussed second.

\subsection{Pulse-Selected Data}
Consider the signals that build the TOF spectrum.  Random background radiation can occur at any time with respect to the beam bunch.  In fact, it should have no knowledge of the beam bunch and is equally likely to occur at every time after a beam bunch.  In other words, the TOF spectrum of background radiation should be flat.  Taking a TOF spectrum with no beam confirms this.

The neutrons coming from the ground state of \As78 are monoenergetic and should come at a fixed time relative to the beam bunch; counts from these neutrons should form a peak that is approximately as narrow in time as the beam bunch.  Looking a a beam-on TOF spectrum, it is clear that the neutron peak and the flat background are not the only features.

The other prominant features of this spectrum are peaks from gammas produced when the beam hits the target and also neutrons from excited states as well as a broad neutron evaporation spectrum from multiple-channel interactions.

In the case of the pulse-selected data, the background that overlaps with the neutron peak of interest is well-determined.  The gamma peaks are far away from the neutron peak and have no effect.  Wonderfully, the broad, flat region ennables a very precise estimate of the random background level.  The neutron evaporation peak is the least-well understood contributor to the background of the ground state neutron peak and will be discussed later.  For now, we focus on the simplest contribution to the background, the flat distribution due to randoms.

In the TOF spectrum, the neutron peak sits on top of random background and also beam-induced background.  If the background is well-known, extracting the counts due to the neutrons is simple:

Sum(peak region) - Background(peak region)

The error associated with this quantity is [ref?]

$sqrt(\sigma_Sum^2 + \sigma_background^2)$

The number of counts in the peak region are a sum of the number of counts in the random background and counts from the neutrons.  The width of a sample at a uniform rate is simply sqrt(N), as seen in figure ??.  This is an appropriate description of the random background.  The neutron peak is roughly gaussian-shaped, and running trials where counts are drawn from a gaussian distribution shows that the width is ??.

Thus $\sigma_{Sum}$ is approximately $sqrt(N_{peakregion})$.

\end{figure}

The error associated with the background depends on how the background is determined.  In most cases, the background is fit.  When the background is fit, the error associated with the number of counts is the error associated with the fit parameters when propagated through the appropriate integral.  For the pulse-selected data, the fit is to a constant and contributes less than a tenth of a percent to the total error.  The non-pulse-selected data does not enjoy such an ambiguous fit and contributes approximately ??\% to the total error.

\subsection{Pulse-Selected Data}
With pulse selection, the region behind the neutron peak has only random signal and can be fit with a constant to within ??\%.  Assuming that the neutron peak itself does not overlap with other background, the total number of counts is estimated as the direct sum of the bin contents minus the average bin content of the background region.  In this case, the error should be the statistical error associated with the random background in the peak region and the statistical error associated with the counts in the neutron peak, added in quadrature.  Such an error neglets the error associated with the constant that is fit, appropriate in this case because it influences the error by at most 0.1\%.

When considering the error, it should be considered that the neutron peak itself may be sitting on top of signal from processes that result in lower-energy neutrons.  A neutron continuum is clearly visible in all targets, and while in 26Mg the continuum is separated by ?? MeV, it is difficult to determine where the continuum for the 76Se and 78Se stops.  What is safe to assume is that neutrons populating the continuum cannot have an energy greater than the 0+ neutron, and so its endpoint cannot extend past the center of the ground state neutron distribution.  Functional models that fit the shape of the continuum well are the Beta Distribution and also the Gamma Distribution.  Both these functions give similar estimates of the background under the neutron peak; the effect is not greater than ??\% even in the largest peaks.

\subsection{Data with No Pulse Selection}
With no pulse selection, the neutron peak sits on top of background from the previous bunch.  Not surprisingly, the sensitivity to the fit to the continuum is larger - as much as ??\% in some cases.

\section{Placing a limit on excited 0+ state cross-sections}
introduce 0+ peak and see when it becomes statistically significant
there will be different limits for different energies!  because of the evaporation background

\section{Fitting 0+ ground state}
DWBA calculation
shell model
f$^2$, p$^2$ state strength ("form factor")

\section{Implications for \zvbb NME}
Okay I'm not really sure how to figure this out
