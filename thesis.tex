% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have

% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean

%
% Normally, you should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \input
% command.  This is all one file for brevity's (and clarity's) sake.
%
% Note that you should also have a good Makefile; one that invokes
% LaTeX as many times as necessary (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
% One should be included in this distribution.  You may want to modify
% the Makefile to make separate chapters, if necessary.

\begin{abstract}
%Currently, significant experimental effort is going toward detecting neutrinoless double beta decay (\zvbb), which, if observed, would give information about the origin of neutrino mass as well as the absolute mass scale of the neutrino.  However, any interpretation of \zvbb lifetimes requires knowledge of the nucleus in which it is observed.  Currently, the nuclear contribution to the lifetime is poorly constrained \citep{zvbbReviewSchwingenheuer}.  This work is part of a larger effort to obtain experimental transfer-reaction data to help constrain these calculations for the candidate nucleus \Ge{76}.  Single-nucleon transfer experiments have been very successful in determining the occupancies of the valence shells in the parent and daughter nuclei \Ge{76} and \Se{76} \citep{valenceProtons,valenceNeutrons}.  Understanding the ground-state pairing of neutrons in \Ge{76} and protons in \Se{76} is also crucial, however.  Neutron pairing in \Ge{76} has already been investigated \citep{neutronPairsGermanium} and has been found to be concentrated almost exclusively in the ground state.  Studies of other candidate isotopes show that neutron and proton pairing behavior can be dramatically different \citep{protonPairsTellurium,neutronPairsTellurium}.  This work investigates proton-pairing strength distribution in \Se{76} with \reaction and finds that there is no evidence that excited \zp states share the pairing strength with the ground state. 
The current experimental effort to detect neutrinoless double beta decay (\zvbb) has encouraged significant interest in understanding the nuclei that are candidates for the observation of this process.  The goal of this thesis is to contribute to the current body of work on the germanium isotopes near \Ge{76}, a candidate nucleus currently being used by several large-scale searches for \zvbb.  Single-nucleon transfer experiments have been very successful in determining the occupancies of the valence shells in the parent and daughter nuclei \Ge{76} and \Se{76}.  However, understanding the ground-state pairing of neutrons in \Ge{76} and protons in \Se{76} is also crucial because \zvbb converts correlated neutron pairs to correlated proton pairs.  Neutron pairing in \Ge{76} has been found to be concentrated almost exclusively in the ground state, but studies on the tellurium isotopes have indicated that a fully neutron-paired ground state does not constrain the distribution of proton-pairing strength.  This work uses the (\He{3},n) transfer reaction with a \Ge{74} target to investigate the proton-pairing strength distribution in \Se{76}.  It is found that proton pairs transfer predominantly to the ground state of \Se{76}.  Proton-pair transfer to excited \zp states in \Se{76} is determined to be less than 4\% of the ground-state pair-transfer strength.
