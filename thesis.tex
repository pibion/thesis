% Sample Notre Dame Thesis/Dissertation

% Nothing in this document is serious except the format.  :-)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is *not* a substitute for Donald's orginial documentation.  See
% /afs/nd.edu/usr/local/src/tex/texmf/doc/latex/ndthesis/ndthesis.dvi
% for documentation on the particular commands and whatnot.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have
% all the relevant parts, put the captions in the right place, etc.
% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean
% that it removes *all* the formatting onus from you.  :-)
%
% Normally, you should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \input
% command.  This is all one file for brevity's (and clarity's) sake.
%
% Note that you should also have a good Makefile; one that invokes
% LaTeX as many times as necessary (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
% One should be included in this distribution.  You may want to modify
% the Makefile to make separate chapters, if necessary.
%
% If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, please send e-mail

\begin{abstract}
A great deal of effort has gone into detecting neutrinoless double beta decay (\zvbb).  But the nuclei that offer the greatest chance of observing this phenomenon are poorly understood.  While an observation of \zvbb has dramatic implications all by itself, there are compelling reasons to better understand the nuclei that might play host to such an event.  The nucleus affects the rate of such an event, important in planning experiments.  And should \zvbb be detected, the nucleus must be well-understood to extract parameters such as the absolute mass scale of the neutrino.

For many years, the nuclear community has worked to piece together a clearer understanding of these nuclei using single-nucleon transfer reactions.  Two-nucleon transfer reactions are also of fundamental importance.  This work investigates two-proton transfer onto \Ge{76} and \Ge{78}.

\begin{preface}
  I would like to preface this work with all the wonderful things that
  Gnus have brought to our society: trees, dirt, flowers, grass,
  lakes, and other earthly-things.  We should not forget them in our
  daily lives.

  Additionally, we should offer them food for all their hard work.  In
  fact, Gnus work so hard that they sleep for the colder half of
  the year.  As such, they tend to grow a little rotund.  Humans
  should not fault them for this, as it is necessary for their
  survival.  Indeed, many humans grow rotund on their on accord!
\end{preface}

\begin{acknowledge}
  I would like to acknowledge all the loving Gnus at Notre Dame.
  Particularly the one that comes to the window in the Hayes Healy
  building.  He (she?) has given me much inspiration, love, and dirt.
  I would also like to thank my advisor, Dr.\ Gary Greenfield, with
  whom this work would not have been possible.

  Finally, I would like to thank the U.S.\ Government, Department of
  Gnus, for their generous grant, number GNU3042920920.3, which
  allowed me to pursue my work.
