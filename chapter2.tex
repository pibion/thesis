\chapter{TRANSFER REACTIONS AND NUCLEAR MATRIX ELEMENTS}
\label{chap:nucl}

\section{Nucleon States and the Impact they Have on NME}
\subsection{NME calculations and valence States}
show how sensitive NME calculations are to occupied valence states

\subsection{Single Nucleon Transfer and Pickup Reactions}
Discuss single nucleon and pickup reactions and what they show about valence state occupation

\subsection{Limitations}
Discuss the limitations faced when all you know about is orbital occupancy

\section{Nucleon-nucleon correlations and the impact they have on NME}
discuss correlation effects on NME
momentum?  momentum of correlated states relevant in \zvbb? compared to momentum of correlated states we probe with our transfer reaction?

\subsection{Two-nucleon transfer reactions}
Discuss current work on two-neutron transfer reactions
INTERPRET

Discuss theory of two-proton transfer reactions
AMY.  THIS IS LIKE THE MAIN TOPIC OF YOUR THESIS!  Should this be its own chapter?
Discuss experimental difficulties of two-proton transfer reactions and introduce NSL as a good place to do them
