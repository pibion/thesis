\chapter{NEUTRINO PHYSICS AND ITS DEPENDENCE ON NUCLEAR PHYSICS}
\label{chap:0vbb}
\section{A Brief Overview of Neutrino Physics}
\begin{comment}
Neutrino physics is fascinating because ??????.
Maybe I will talk about particles in general - but no, that's probably a bit too much.
I will mention the standard model table and talk about why neutrinos are important in physics today?

The neutrino was first proposed as a undetectable particle that carried away energy in nuclear decay processes \cite{Pauli}.  Twenty-six years later (fact check!), Reines and Cowan detected inverse beta decay to detect antineutrinos streaming out of a nearby nuclear reactor \cite{poltergeist}.  Detecting neutrinos is difficult: with an interaction volume of 10$^{26}$ potential targets, Reines and Cowan saw 1 event per week (FACT CHECK!!) \cite{poltergeist}.  Simply confirming the existence of the particle hypothesized to participate in beta decay was significant enough to merit the Nobel Prize \cite{CowanNobel}.

While detecting neutrinos is a difficult endeavor, it's also a lucrative one: particles that interact extremely rarely carry information about where they're created, no matter what they have to travel through to get to us.  With a detector that counts neutrinos, one can begin to imagine interrogating the cosmos: ``How many neutrinos are you making?  And you?  And you?''  Bahcahll was interested in finding out how many neutrinos the sun made.  And so he and Ray Davis set out to make a good neutrino counter. 

(AMY!  You're neglecting to talk about the experiment that demonstrated the left-handedness of neutrinos by Goldhaber in 1958.  This is kind of relevant to \zvbb!)
\end{comment}

The neutrino, a massless, chargeless particle, was first proposed by Pauli \cite{Pauli} as a means to preserve momentum conservation in nuclear beta decay.  The hypothesized process was
\begin{equation}
n \rightarrow p + e^- + \overline{v_e},
\end{equation}
where a neutron $n$ decays into a proton $p$, an electron $e^-$, and also an electron anti-neutrino $\overline{v_e}$, allowing the continuous electron energy spectrum that was observed. The existence of this difficult-to-detect particle was not confirmed until 26 years later, when Reines and Cowan used a nuclear reactor as a source of antineutrinos and observed inverse beta decay of proton targets \cite{poltergeist}.  Since the first detection of electron anti-neutrinos, an impressive amount has been learned about these elusive particles.  This chapter will begin by discussing what is currently known about neutrinos, in particular that there are three, unique flavors and that while they are very light, they do have mass.  Understanding how neutrinos get their mass in the Standard Model framework and the experiments currently underway to help determine the nature of the neutrino occupies the rest of the chapter.

\subsection{Neutrino Oscillation - the beginning}
Neutrinos interact very weakly with matter, and while this makes their detection difficult, it also makes them a potentially valuable source of information.  Studying the interior of systems that produce neutrinos becomes possible with a neutrino detector, while other forms of radiation would be absorbed long before reaching scientist's detectors.  Ray Davis and John Bahcahll recognized the neutrino could be used to test the theory that nuclear fusion was the sun's energy source.  The neutrino detector built by Ray Davis consisted of 100,000 [CITE] gallons of $^{37}$Cl, which was readily available as dry cleaning fluid.  Solar neutrinos interacting with $^{37}$Cl that inverse-beta decay into $^{37}$Ar leave a detectable signal, as $^{37}$Ar is radioactive.  Years of careful data taking yeilded a count of $\sim$7 neutrinos per two weeks \cite{Davis}, only $\frac{1}{3}$ the rate predicted by Bahcall [CITE].  Further refinements to the experiment and to the calculations confirmed the discrepancy [CITE].

While the Davis experiment continued to collect data, other experiments began that explored the neutrino itself.  Originally imagined as a single particle, it was found that there are three distinct flavors of neutrinos, each associated with a lepton partner.  It is important to note that the decay 
\begin{equation}
p \rightarrow n + \overbar{l} + v_l,
\end{equation}
where $l$ is an electron, muon, or tau, requires the proton to have enough momentum relative to the target neutron to create the lepton $l$.  Even the highest-energy nuclear reactions in the sun provide only $\sim$11~MeV, so that the sun can produce only electron neutrinos.  Energetic pion beams at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) provided the first direct measurement of muon neutrinos \cite{muonNeutrino}.  Later, accelerated proton beams at Fermilab were used to successfully detect tau neutrinos \cite{tauNeutrino}.

By 2001, physicists were confident that there were three flavors of light neutrinos (CITE Z-width experiment!) - the electron neutrino, $\nu_e$, the muon neutrino, $\nu_{\mu}$, and, last to be directly observed (CITE DONUT from FNAL!!), the tau neutrino, $\nu_{\tau}$.  If one assumed the neutrino had mass - a reasonable assumption (since presumably SOME EXPERIMENTS?? had put LOW LIMITS?? on its mass?  why else did we think this?), helicity is then always a good quantum number, with the neutrino (whose lepton number is +1) being left-handed and the anti-neutrino (lepton number = -1) being right-handed.  (AMY.  Left-handed-ness?  Right?  Helicity?  You need to define these terms and make them relevant!  Aaaaugh!!)

As Davis and Bahcall slowly convinced their peers that the discrepancy between their results represented real science, experiments began in earnest to find the sun's missing neutrinos.  (Gallex 1991, SAGE 1989, Kamiokande, SNO 1999)  GALLEX and SAGE were experiments that used $^{71}$Ga to detect solar neutrinos; inverse beta-decay on this nucleus has a lower threshold than does $^{37}$Cl, but even with sensitivity to lower-energy neutrinos, the problem of missing neutrinos persisted.  What was needed was a detector that was sensitive to all flavors of neutrinos rather than only electron neutrinos, and in 1999 the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) began taking data.

Experiments that rely on inverse beta decay caused by solar neutrinos are only sensitive to electron neutrinos because even the most energy neutrinos can be created with in the sun is 11 MeV (from hep? and 8B? CITE, yo).  The mass of $^{37}$Cl is 34433.5165 MeV while the mass of $^{37}$Ar is 34434.3034 MeV; the mass difference is 0.8139 MeV.  But to satisfy energy conservation, the neutrino must have not only enough energy to make up this mass difference, but also enough energy to produce an electron, bringing the total required energy to a minimum of 1.3249 MeV for this process.  While the $^{71}$Ga used in GALLEX and SAGE required much less energy of its neutrinos for inverse beta decay (only 0.2326 MeV for the mass difference between nuclei!), it is easy to see that the even the most energetic of solar neutrinos

Talk about experiments that constrain these parameters?  This seems far afield, maybe.

Okay, yes.  Here is how this section could go: discuss the process and the resulting equation for the lifetime, and then talk about each of the components of the equation.  START with the discussion of the lifetime - can include details of ongoing experiments there.
