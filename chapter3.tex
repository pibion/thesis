\chapter{TWO PROTON TRANSFER AT NOTRE DAME}
\label{chap:2pExpt}

\begin{comment}
Give an overview of the requirements for two-proton transfer and say that ND has a buncher and a Tandem accelerator that goes up to 10 MV so we can get beam energies up to 30 MeV for \He{3} and we have a beamline with a long flight path SO we can do this experiment.
\end{comment}

The previous chapter demonstrated the interest in studying the (\He{3},n) transfer reaction onto \GeTargets ; this chapter will discuss the beam production and experimental setup that are necessary for measuring the angular distribution of this reaction.

\He{3} beam is an excellent candidate for studying two-proton transfer.  The Helium Ion Source (HIS) at Notre Dame can produce 1-2 microamps ($\mu$A) of negatively charged (1-) Helium beam.  To make \He{3} beam, \He{3} gas must be provided to the ion source.  

As discussed in the previous chapter, the purpose of this experiment is to understand the strength of the 0+ ground state.  Maximizing the 0+ cross section requires a beam energy near 18 MeV.  High beam energies come at a cost - the resolution of the neutron detector decreases with increasing neutron energy.  However, the 0+ cross section drops drastically before and after its maximum.  Choosing a lower energy, while increasing resolution, would threaten the ability of the neutron detectors to see any signal at all above noise.

The resulting products of a two-proton transfer onto \Ge{76} are a neutron and a \Se{78} nucleus.  While the heavy, charged \Se{78} nucleus is unlikely to escape the target, the escaping neutron provides a way to study this reaction.

An effective search for angular momentum states can be done with detectors that are segmented in angle, providing a differential cross-section.  Because the states of interest are 0+ states, the angular range most important to cover is 0 to 22 degrees, the maximum and the minimum of the differential cross section.  The neutron detector consists of 16 independent plastic bars, each spanning approximately 1 degree, from 7 degrees to 22 degrees as shown in figure ??.

The neutron detectors are instrumented to provide both an energy signal and a time signal.  But the neutron detectors are not the whole story.  As discussed in the previous chapter, the absolute differential cross section helps determine the occupancies in the target nucleus.  The amount of beam on target must be well-known, and so detectors are placed near the target to provide a way to monitor the beam current.


\section{Beam Production at Notre Dame}
The beam delivered to the target is 16 MeV bunched \He{3}.  In this section, we will follow the beam through its production and accelaration.

The Helium Ion Source (HIS) provides negative \He{3} ions to the accelerator.  A duoplasmatron ion source filled with \He{3} gas uses a discharge across high voltage to convert some of the gas into plasma.  Electrostatic elements extract the plasma into a canal filled with lithium vapor.  Lithium is crucial to creating negatively charged beam because it donates electrons generously, and some \He{3} becomes ionized after passing through the canal.  A dipole magnet after the ion source removes the carbon, oxygen, and other impurities that contaminate the \He{3} beam.  Movable, thick tungsten slits block much of the beam, allowing only beam within a small range of magnetic rigidity to pass through to the accelerator.

The accelerator at Notre Dame is a Van deGraaff accelerator made by High Voltage Engineering Corporation.  Its maximum terminal potential is 10 MV.  Beam enters the accelerator negatively charged and accelerates toward the positive terminal, located in the center of the machine. A thin carbon foil ($\sim$ 3 $\mu$g/cm$^2$) in the center of the machine strips all the electrons from the beam.  The now-positive beam accelerates again, away from the positive terminal. In the case of \He{3} beam, then, the energy of the accelerated beam with a terminal voltage of $V_T$ is 

\begin{equation}
E = 3V_T
\end{equation}

For 16 MeV \He{3} beam, the terminal voltage required is 5.33 MV, easily provided by the accelerator.  An ion source and an accelerator alone can produce a particular beam, some of which is at the desired energy.  But the energy spread of the beam leaving the accelerator is ?? MeV and would greatly decrease the resolution of the experiment.  Additionally, the beam is diffuse.  It must arrive focused on the target, which is ?? m away.  To produce a focused, near-monoenergetic beam at the target, beam selection using dipoles and slits and also focusing elements are necessary.  These will be discussed in the next section.


\subsection{Beam Focusing and Selection}

Beam exiting the accelerator has a large energy spread.  Dipole magnets can select beam based on rigidity; since the mass and charge of the desired beam are fixed, a dipole acts as a momentum filter.  A large dipole magnet with beam-stopping slits at its exit leaves the beam with an energy spread of only 10 keV.  The magnetic field strength is calibrated against the nuclear magenetic resonance (NMR) of hydrogen.  Comparing this energy spread to the energy spread introduced by the target gives a sense of how small the error associated with the beam energy is; the target spreads the energy by 0.5 MeV.

The accelerated beam must travel in vacuum from the accelerator to a target.  Many focusing and steering elements along the way are necessary to obtain a reasonable transmission rate.  Two Einzel lenses [need cite] focus the beam before it enters the accelerator, and a set of electrostatic steerers before and after the accelerator are enough to position the beam before it enters the energy-selecting dipole magnet.

Quadrupole doublet magnets focus the beam as it travels through the target rooms, and another set of steerers allows correction of the beam position and angle.  The final focusing element before the target are two large-bore, variable-strength solenoid magnets [cite needed] that focus the beam to a spot approximately 2 mm in diameter.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Beam Bunching}

Continuous beam would make it impossibile for our detectors to determine the neutron TOF.  It is possible to bunch the beam so that ``bunches'' of \He{3} arrive at the target, each bunch having a time spread of approximately one ns.  

The beam buncher at Notre Dame works by slowing down particles that would arrive too early at the target and speeding up particles that would be arriving too late.  To acheive this, two grids perpendicular to the beam connect to a radiofrequency (RF) power supply to create an intense electric field that varies in time.  If the electric field were a sawtooth wave in time, the beam bunches would contain all the beam.  Commercially available RF power supplies providing adequate current and rapid enough signal, however, generally vary sinusoidally in time.  At some beam facilities \cite{LynchBunching}, multiple RF amplifiers provide additional frequncies, better approximating a sawtooth wave.  A ``triple-harmonic buncher'' \cite{LynchBunching} generates the correct amplitude, frequency, and phases of the first three Fourier components of a sawtooth wave, which results in adequate bunching of $\sim$80\% of the incident unbunched beam.  However, this requires several expensive RF amplifiers and complicated control electronics.  At Notre Dame, a single frequency buncher that operates at 9.85 MHz is used.  The best bunching occurs while the RF signal is increasing approximately linearly with time; when the electric field is decreasing, de-bunching occurs.  At the target, nanosecond (ns) wide bunches contain $\sim$40\% of the beam and arrive at the target every 101 ns on top of the remaining continuous beam.  This continuous beam would render our time signal useless and must somehow be removed.

% figure: how a beam buncher works

\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/beamBunching.eps}
\label{fig:bunching}
\caption{Beam bunching using a varying electric field.}
\end{figure}

The ``sweeper'' provides a large electric field that ramps up and down very quickly to remove the unwanted beam between the bunches.  While conceptually simple, the time scale required for the charging of the plates makes it difficult to find a commercially available power supply.  The field must turn ``on'' on a timescale much smaller than the beam bunch, or else become the limiting factor in the time-width of the bunch.  The power supply used provides ?? charge in ?? ns.

%figure of beam profile and sweeper

At Notre Dame, the beam bunches are 101.5 ns apart and are typically 1 ns to 2 ns wide.  This bunch spacing presents a problem for the experiment because the spread in TOF of the neutron spectrum is in excess of 200 ns.  With bunches arriving at the target every 100 ns, it will be impossible to tell if a neutron is very fast and associated with the current bunch or very slow and associated with the previous bunch.  The spectrum will be considerably complicated by this ambiguity, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PSvsNPS_TOF}.

\caption{Figure A shows timing spectrum from a pulse-selected beam.  The timing spectrum in figure B is from beam with no pulse selection.  Both timing spectra are from a \He{3} beam on a \Ge{76} target.}
\end{figure}

To give all the neutrons resulting from one beam bunch time to reach the detector before the next bunch strikes, a ``pulse selector'' eliminates three of every four bunches, resulting in 400 ns between each bunch at the cost of beam intensity.  Even with 400 ns between bunches, very slow neutrons from previous bunches overlap with $\gamma$ rays from the current bunch, but these are eliminated by placing an energy cut that selects against very low energy neutrons.

% figure: slow neutrons and their dissappearance

Beam bunching and pulse selection dramatically reduces available beam - the swept beam current is only 40\% $\times$ $\frac{1}{4} = 10$\% of the non-bunched current.  But without bunched beam it would not be possible to distinguish the neutrons of interest in the (\He{3},n) transfer reaction.  As it happens, however, the Notre Dame facility cannot improve the statistics of this experiment by very much because the radiation limits on the room with the detector are so low that even with pulse selection, the beam is near its maximum allowed current.

\section{The Target Chamber}

The absolute cross section is the number of times a reaction occurred normalized by the total number of particles incident on the target and the number density of nuclei in the target:

\begin{equation}
\text{cross section} = \frac{\text{times reaction occurred}}{\text{particles incident on target} \times \text{number density of target nuclei}}

\text{cross section} = \frac{\text{times reaction occurred}}{\text{particle current} \times \text{time} \times \text{target thickness}}
\label{eq:cross_section}
\end{equation}

How many reactions occured and the target thickness do not affect the setup of the detector.  Calculating the number of reactions requires the efficiency of the detector.  Chapter ?? discusses this in detail.  The efficiency is approximately 3\% for all bars.  The target thickness is well-known from RBS measurements; the results are summarized in Chapter ?? and a description of the analysis is in Appendix ??.  Maintaining good energy resolution does dictate a target choice, however.  Because the \Ge{76} targets are too thin to be self-supporting, they are backed by a gold foil.  The target is positioned so that the first material the beam encounters is Ge.  Resulting neutrons can pass through the gold without the energy straggling that would afflict the \He{3} were it to pass through the gold.

The need for accurate time and particle current both affect the experimental setup.  The DAQ provides a 100 Hz NIM logic pulse, providing a measure of time.  But the DAQ cannot collect new events while it is processing an event.  A measure of the time experienced by the DAQ is the appropriate time to use when calculating the cross section.  In addition to a 100 Hz signal, the DAQ also provides a NIM logic pulse that is low when the DAQ is busy.  Vetoing the timing signal with this busy signal gives the live time needed for the cross section calculation.  The schematic is shown in figure ??.

There are several ways to record information about the particle current.  The most reliable is to measure RBS from the gold backing with a Silicon detector.  Because the \Mg{26} target is self-supporting, it is necessary to record other measures, such as the charge collected on the beamstop and the gamma reaction to a small NaI2 crystal, both of which show a linear relationship with the beam current within statistical error.

but neutron detection imposes an additional constraint on the beam.  The resulting products of a two-proton transfer onto \Ge{76} are a neutron and a \Se{78} nucleus.  Our detector has a relatively small neutron detection efficiency, but the heavy, charged \Se{78} nucleus is unlikely to escape the target, forcing us to rely on neutron detection to study this reaction. 

What does a neutron signal look like in such a detector?  If the neutron always deposited its full energy in the detector, the energy spectrum would show sharp peaks corresponding to each neutron energy.  However, a neutron interacting with a proton only transfers all its energy to that proton in a head-on collision.  Monoenergetic neutrons will deposit a range of energy in the detector, from no energy at all to their full energy.  This makes it impossible to determine the energy of the neutron from its deposited energy.  In this transfer experiment, it is necessary to distinguish neutrons with different energies.  Because the neutron's deposited energy does not determine that neutron's full energy, the experiment must be sensitive to some quantity that gives unambiguous information about the neutron's energy.

The neutron energy uniquely determines the time it takes for the neutron to travel from the target to the detector in \eq \ref{eq:TOF}.  

\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - m^2c^4}{E^2}}
\label{eq:TOF}
\end{equation}

Measuring the time of flight (TOF) of the neutron to sufficient accuracy requires both beam bunching and a long neutron flight path.  In a continuous beam, there is no way to know which \He{3} was associated with a neutron event in the detector, and therefore no way to determine TOF.  Bunching the beam so that clumps of \He{3} arrive at the same time and providing a signal correlated to their arrival at the target allows a TOF measurement with a precision determined by the time-width of the bunch.  This limit on time resolution constrains the distance between the target and detector.  The flight path must be long enough to distinguish ground state neutrons from neutrons associated excited states of the residual nucleus.  In the case of \Ge{76},  the energies of the ground and first excited state neutrons differ by only 0.5 MeV out of $\sim$25 MeV.  With a flight path of 1 m between the target and detector, the difference in time between these two neutrons is ?? ns - far less than the resolution determined by the beam bunch.  In all experiments discussed, the flight path is approximately 15 m, the largest allowed by the room, to maximize energy resolution.  

The neutron detector consists of 16 large (1.5 m $\times$ 0.15 m $\times$ 0.05 m) bars of commercially available scintillator [reference BC408?].  The detectors sit in a rough circle with a radius of $\sim$15 m centered around the target.  The forwardmost angle relative to the beam is 5$^{\circ}$ and the largest angle is $21^{\circ}$.  The angle step size between each detector is approximately 0.7$^{\circ}$.  The detectors sit 14.6 m away from the target to ensure a resolution of at least 0.5 MeV at 22 MeV.  At this distance comes the solid angle of each detector is only 10 cm/15 m $\times$ 2.5 m/15 m = 0.11 sr.

% figure - picture of detector

The plastic scintillator bars are each equipped with two photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) with signal risetimes of approximately 5 ns.  Because the PMT's have such a fast risetime, they provide excellent timing information as well as energy information.  Energy deposited is not useful for neutron identification; it is timing information that indentifies neutrons.  In principle, the timing information is all the data acquisition (DAQ) needs to record.  This would be true if there were no background radiation, but concrete in the room emits low-energy $\gamma$ radiation that leaves signal in the detector at a high rate.  Measuring the energy deposition is necessary because it allows us to eliminate this low-energy background radiation.  

While energy information is necessary, it does not need to be terribly precise.  The timing information, however, is the only information useful for neutron identification and must be as precise as possible.  The goal for the electronics is to not add spread to the timing that is noticable above the timing spread already inherent in the beam bunching.  This is why the detectors are equipped with PMT's that have excellent timing response.  The 5 ns PMT signal risetime, together with Constant Fraction Discriminators (CFD's), give timing information with jitter that is about 1 ns.

% figure: CFD operation

The time resolution of the TOF spectrum is limited by the time spread of the beam bunch and is approximately 1.5 ns.  A 16 MeV \He{3} can populate many excited states in \GeTargets; the energy difference between the ground and first excited state, together with the time resolution, determines the minimum flight path.

% figure: \Ge{76}, 74Ge level scheme

Conservation of energy and momentum determines the time $t$ it takes for a neutron with relativistic momentum $p$ to travel the distance $d$ between the target and the detector.

\begin{equation}
t(p) = \frac{d}{v} = d\times\sqrt{\frac{m^2+p^2/c^2}{p^2}}
\label{eq:TOF2}
\end{equation}


Requiring a separation between the ground state and first excited state of \Ge{76} that is greater than or equal to the time resolution,

\begin{equation}
d = \Delta t/v = 1.5 ns / v \sim 15 m
\label{eq:requiredDist}
\end{equation}

The room is too small for this flight path; the largest it can accomodate is 14.6 m, so cleanly separating the ground state from the first excited state will be difficult in \GeTargets.

\subsection{Electronics}
When a real event occurs in some bar of the neutron detector, the DAQ must record the energy and time of both the top and bottom PMT of that bar.  A charge to digital converter (QDC) can integrate the PMT signal and a time to digital converter (TDC) can measure the time between a logic pulse created by the PMT signal and the logic pulse from the beam buncher.  Because time resolution is crucial, constant fraction discriminators (CFD's) and not leading edge discriminators create the logic pulse sent to the TDC.  

The lone signal provided by the PMT base is not adequate for this processing because two signals, one for the QDC and one for the TDC, are necessary.  The signal from the PMT base is also too small to trigger the CFD's.  The $\times$10 amplifier makes the signal large enough to trigger the CFD's and provides two copies of the input signal, one which can be analyzed for timing information while the other is analyzed for energy information.  A simplified diagram of the data acquisition is shown in fig \ref{fig:simpleElectronics}.

\end{figure}

What is a good trigger to construct for the neutron wall?  For just one neutron detector, triggering any time the top or bottom PMT fired would waste the DAQ with recording many noise events.  A real event should create signals in both the top and bottom PMT's, and requiring a coincidence between the two results in a reasonable trigger.  One way to define an event trigger for the entire neutron wall, then, would be to trigger any time a coincidence between associated top and bottom PMT's occurs.  But constructing this trigger with NIM logic units requires 16 separate logic gates and would require purchasing additional, expensive logic modules.  

The solution is to use the built-in OR of the CFD.  Instead of requiring a top and bottom signal in the same bar, the condition is loosened to requiring a signal in a top PMT and a bottom PMT in the same eight-bar group.  Each CFD is an eight-fold unit that receives only top or bottom signals and provides an OR output.  The presence of some top signal AND some bottom signal triggers the event signal.  Such an event only requires that both a top and a bottom signal coincided but does not require that these signals belonged to the same bar.  Such an event trigger includes all events of interest, where the top and bottom signal belong to one bar, but also includes spurious events where no bar has signal in both its top and bottom PMT.  With a dead time of less than 30\%, this event condition does not hinder data collection, and simple software cuts eliminate spurious events.
