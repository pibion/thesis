\chapter{TWO PROTON TRANSFER AT NOTRE DAME}
\label{chap:2pExpt}

\begin{comment}
Give an overview of the requirements for two-proton transfer and say that ND has a buncher and a Tandem accelerator that goes up to 10 MV so we can get beam energies up to 30 MeV for \He{3} and we have a beamline with a long flight path SO we can do this experiment.
\end{comment}

The previous chapter demonstrated the interest in studying the (\He{3},n) transfer reaction onto \GeTargets ; this chapter will discuss the beam and detector properties that are necessary for measuring the angular distribution of this reaction.

One obvious requirement is \He{3} beam.  The Helium Ion Source (HIS) at Notre Dame can produce 1-2 microamps ($\mu$A) of negatively charged (1-) Helium beam.  To make \He{3} beam, \He{3} gas must be provided to the ion source.  While in principle this is not difficult, in practice \He{3} gas is very expensive and requires government approval for its purchase.  

Another consideration is the beam energy.  Because the reaction of interest is a nuclear reaction, the energy must be above the Coulomb barrier.  To maximize the cross section, the beam energy must be near 18 MeV.

The Tandem Van deGraaff accelerator at Notre Dame has a maximum terminal voltage of 10 mega volts (MV).  Beam extracted from the HIS is singly, negatively ionized by Lithium vapor.  The beam stays in this ionization state until it encounters a carbon foil in the center of the accelerator terminal and is stripped of all its electrons, leaving it \He{3}$^{2+}$.  In the case of \He{3} beam, then, the energy of the accelerated beam with a terminal voltage of $V_t$ is 

\begin{equation}
E = 3V_T
\end{equation}

For 16 MeV \He{3} beam, the terminal voltage required is 5.33 MV, easily provided by the accelerator.

The facility at Notre Dame can easily supply the necessary beam at the ideal energy.  But neutron detection imposes an additional constraint on the beam.

The resulting products of a two-proton transfer onto \Ge{76} are a neutron and a \Se{78} nucleus.  Our detector has a relatively small neutron detection efficiency, but the heavy, charged \Se{78} nucleus is unlikely to escape the target, forcing us to rely on neutron detection to study this reaction.  

Imagine for a moment the options that are available to the neutron that wishes to interact with any detector.  It has no charge, so disturbing electrons via the electromagnetic force is not possible.  The neutron can interact with the electrons weakly, but this probability is impractically small.  A neutron may also interact with a proton, strongly.  This strong interaction is predominantly responsible for neutron detection.  A neutron that transfers some of its energy to a proton can rely on the charged proton to interact with the solid's electrons and register a signal in the detector.  What experimenters must do is provide plenty of protons for neutrons to collide with - large quantities of water or plastics, with their long hydrocarbon chains, are popular choices.

What does a neutron signal look like in such a detector?  If the neutron always deposited its full energy in the detector, the energy spectrum would show sharp peaks corresponding to each neutron energy.  However, a neutron interacting with a proton only transfers all its energy to that proton in a head-on collision.  Monoenergetic neutrons will deposit a range of energy in the detector, from no energy at all to their full energy.  This makes it impossible to determine the energy of the neutron from its deposited energy.  In this transfer experiment, it is necessary to distinguish neutrons with different energies.  Because the neutron's deposited energy does not determine that neutron's full energy, the experiment must be sensitive to some quantity that gives unambiguous information about the neutron's energy.

The neutron energy uniquely determines the time it takes for the neutron to travel from the target to the detector in \eq \ref{eq:TOF}.  

\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - m^2c^4}{E^2}}
\label{eq:TOF}
\end{equation}

Measuring the time of flight (TOF) of the neutron to sufficient accuracy requires both beam bunching and a long neutron flight path.  In a continuous beam, there is no way to know which \He{3} was associated with a neutron event in the detector, and therefore no way to determine TOF.  Bunching the beam so that clumps of \He{3} arrive at the same time and providing a signal correlated to their arrival at the target allows a TOF measurement with a precision determined by the time-width of the bunch.  This limit on time resolution constrains the distance between the target and detector.  The flight path must be long enough to distinguish ground state neutrons from neutrons associated excited states of the residual nucleus.  In the case of \Ge{76},  the energies of the ground and first excited state neutrons differ by only 0.5 MeV out of ~25 MeV.  With a flight path of 1 m between the target and detector, the difference in time between these two neutrons is ?? ns - far less than the resolution determined by the beam bunch.  In all experiments discussed, the flight path is approximately 15 m, the largest allowed by the room, to maximize energy resolution.  

\section{Bunched Beam Production at Notre Dame}
The beam delivered to the target is ?? MeV bunched \He{3}.  In this section, we will follow the beam through its production and accelaration.

The accelerator at Notre Dame is a Van deGraaff accelerator made by High Voltage Engineering Corporation.  Its maximum terminal potential is 10 MV.  Beam enters the accelerator negatively charged and accelerates toward the positive terminal, located in the center of the machine. A thin carbon foil (~ 3 $\mu$g/cm$^2$) in the center of the machine strips the electrons from the beam.  The now-positive beam accelerates again, away from the positive terminal.  

The Helium Ion Source (HIS) provides negative \He{3} ions to the accelerator.  A duoplasmatron ion source filled with \He{3} gas uses a discharge across high voltage to convert some of the gas into plasma.  Electrostatic elements extract the plasma into a canal filled with lithium vapor.  Lithium is crucial to creating negatively charged beam because it donates electrons generously, and some \He{3} becomes ionized after passing through the canal.  A dipole magnet after the ion source removes the carbon, oxygen, and other impurities that contaminate the \He{3} beam.  Movable, thick tungsten slits block much of the beam, allowing only beam within a small range of magnetic rigidity to pass through to the accelerator.

The accelerated beam again encounters a large dipole magnet that selects beam of the desired energy.  The magnetic field strength is adjusted using the nuclear magenetic resonance (NMR) of hydrogen and leaves the beam with an energy spread of approximately 10 keV.  Comparing this energy spread to the energy spread introduced by the target gives a sense of how small the error associated with the beam energy is; the target spreads the energy by 0.5 MeV.

\subsection{Beam Focusing}

The accelerated beam must travel in vacuum from the accelerator to a target.  Many focusing and steering elements along the way are necessary to obtain a reasonable transmission rate.  Two Einzel lenses [need cite] focus the beam before it enters the accelerator, and a set of electrostatic steerers before and after the accelerator are enough to position the beam before it enters the energy-selecting dipole magnet.

Quadrupole doublet magnets focus the beam as it travels through the target rooms, and another set of steerers allows correction of the beam position and angle.  The final focusing element before the target are two large-bore, variable-strength solenoid magnets [cite needed] that focus the beam to a spot approximately 2 mm in diameter.

\label{fig:beamline}
\caption{Beam production at Notre Dame.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Beam Bunching}

Continuous beam would make it impossibile for our detectors to distinguish between beam-related neutron events and gamma events.  It is possible to bunch the beam so that ``bunches'' of \He{3} arrive at the target, each bunch having a time spread of less than one ns.  

The beam buncher at Notre Dame works by slowing down particles that would arrive too early at the target and speeding up particles that would be arriving too late.  To acheive this, two grids perpendicular to the beam connect to a power supply create an electric field that varies in time.  Bunching all the beam requires that the electric field be a triangle wave in time, but commercially available power supplies providing adequate current and rapid enough signal generally vary sinusoidally in time.  At some beam facilities \cite{LynchBunching}, multiple power supplies provide additional frequncies, better approximating a triangle wave.  At Notre Dame, one frequency, 11 MHz, is used.  The best bunching occurs when the wave is at its steepest; when the electric field is changing very slowly, little bunching occurs.  The effect of the bunching, then, is that the beam is continuous, with large bunches every 101 ns.  The beam in between these bunches would render our time signal useless, and must somehow be removed.

The ``sweeper'' provides a large electric field that ramps up and down very quickly to remove the unwanted beam between the bunches.  While conceptually simple, the time scale required for the charging of the plates makes it difficult to find a commercially available power supply.  The field must turn ``on'' on a timescale much smaller than the beam bunch, or else become the limiting factor in the time-width of the bunch.  The power supply used provides ?? charge in ?? ns.

%figure of beam profile and sweeper

The beam buncher and sweeper are all that is needed to provide bunched beam.  At Notre Dame, the beam bunches are 101.52 ns apart and are typically 1 ns to 2 ns wide.  This bunch spacing presents a problem for the experiment because the neutron TOF is in excess of 200 ns.  With bunches arriving at the target every 100 ns, it will be impossible to tell if a neutron is very slow and associated with bunch A or very fast and associated with bunch B.  The spectrum will be considerably complicated.

\caption{Figure A shows timing spectrum from a pulse-selected beam.  The timing spectrum in figure B is from beam with no pulse selection.  Both timing spectra are from a \He{3} beam on a \Ge{76} target.}
\end{figure}

To give all the neutrons resulting from one beam bunch time to reach the detector before the next bunch strikes, a ``pulse selector'' knocks out three of every four bunches, resulting in 300 ns between each bunch.  Even with such generous time between bunches, very slow neutrons from previous bunches overlap with gammas from the current bunch.  These vanish with a low energy cut.

% figure: slow neutrons and their dissappearance

Beam bunching dramatically reduces available beam - swept beam current is ?? less than its non-bunched.  But without bunched beam it would not be possible to distinguish the neutrons of interest in the (\He{3},n) transfer reaction.  Despite this limited current, the Notre Dame facility cannot improve the statistics of this experiment beyond a factor of ?? because the radiation limits on the room with the detector are so low that even with pulse selection, the beam is near its maximum allowed current.


\section{The Neutron Detector}
\begin{comment}
Discuss neutron wall briefly.  Can reference NIMA paper. Explain why it's important that it's wide-angle. 
Electronics diagram!  Discuss two most important aspects: TDC and ADC from phototubes
\end{comment}

The neutron detectors are large strips of high density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic doped with scintillator (what kind of scintillator??).  Sixteen independent detectors sit in a rough circle around the target, with the forwardmost angle being 5$^{\circ}$ and the largest angle being $21^{\circ}$.  The angle step size between each detector is approximately 0.7$^{\circ}$.  The detectors sit 15.6 m away from the target to ensure a resolution of at least 0.5 MeV at 22 MeV.  This distance comes at a steep price; the solid angle is only (approx. 10 cm/15 m x 2.5 m/15 m = 0.11) sr, or 0.88\% of the unit circle.

% figure - picture of detector

The plastic scintillator, equipped with fast timing PMT's, are sensitive to energy deposition and time.  Energy deposited is not useful for neutron identification; it is timing information that ID's neutrons.  In principle, the timing information is all the DAQ needs to record.  This would be true if only there were no background radiation!  The low-energy gamma radiation from the concrete leaves signal in the detector at a high rate - much higher than the rate of beam! Measuring the Energy deposition is crucial because it allows us to throw out low-energy background from the room.  

What is clear is that while energy information is necessary, the energy information does not need to be terribly precise.  The timing information, however, must be as precise as possible.  The goal for the electronics is to not add spread to the timing that is noticable above the timing spread already inherent in the beam bunching.  The detectors are equipped with photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) at the top and bottom that have excellent timing response - their risetime is approximately 5 ns.  Constant Fraction Discriminators (CFD's) give timing information with jitter that's less than 1 ns.

\subsection{Electronics}
When a real event occurs in some bar of the neutron detector, the DAQ must record the energy and time of both the top and bottom PMT of that bar.  A QDC can integrate the PMT signal and a TDC can measure the time between a logic pulse created by the PMT signal and the logic pulse from the beam buncher.  Because time resolution is crucial, constant fraction discriminators (CFD's) and not leading edge discriminators create the logic pulse sent to the TDC.  

The lone signal provided by the PMT base is not adequate for this processing because two signals, one for the QDC and one for the TDC, are necessary.  The signal from the PMT base is also too small to trigger the CFD's.  The ?? x10 amplifier makes the signal large enough to trigger the CFD's and provides two copies of the input signal, one which can be analyzed for timing information while the other is analyzed for energy information.  A diagram of the data acquisition concept is shown in fig ??.

\caption{A simplified diagram of the neutron detector electronics showing the acquisition of timing and energy information from the detectors.}
\end{figure}

What is a good trigger to construct for the neutron wall?  For just one neutron detector, triggering any time the top or bottom PMT fired would waste the DAQ with recording many noise events.  A real event should result in signal in both the top and bottom PMT's, and requiring a coincidence between the two results in a reasonable trigger.  One way to define an event trigger for the entire neutron wall, then, would be to trigger any time a coincidence between associated top and bottom PMT's occurs.  But constructing this trigger with NIM logic units requires 16 separate logic gates and would require purchasing additional, expensive logic modules.  

The solution is to use the built-in 'OR' of the CFD.  Instead of requiring a top and bottom signal in the same bar, the condition is loosened to requiring a signal in a top PMT and a bottom PMT in the same eight-bar group.  Each CFD is an eight-fold unit and provides an 'OR' output.  Each CFD receives only top or bottom signals.  The presence of some top signal AND some bottom signal triggers the event signal.  Such an event only knows that both a top and bottom signal coincided but is blind to whether or not these signals belonged to the same bar.  Such an event trigger includes all events where the top and bottom signal belong to one bar but also includes spurious events where no bar has signal in both its top and bottom PMT.  With a dead time of less than 30\%, this event condition does not hinder data collection, and simple software cuts eliminate spurious events.

\section{Setup}
\begin{comment}
Flight path and time resolution as a function of neutron energy - apply this to Ge ground and first excited state!
Beam monitor
Dead time
Include a sample calculation?  Like: this is what we see in the detector.  To get an absolute cross-section, here is the calculation:
counts * time * particle current * target thickness
So we get the counts this way and the time with the signal from the DAQ and the target thickness from Hope
\end{comment}

The time resolution of the TOF spectrum is limited by the time spread of the beam bunch and is approximately 1.5 ns.  An 18 MeV \He{3} can populate many excited states in 76,74Ge; the energy difference between the ground and first excited state, together with the time resolution, determines the minimum flight path.

% figure: \Ge{76}, 74Ge level scheme

Conservation of energy and momentum determines the time it takes for a neutron of energy En to travel the distance d between the target and the detector.

\begin{equation}
t(E) = 
\label{eq:TOF2}
\end{equation}


Requiring a separation between the ground state and first excited state of \Ge{76} that is greater than or equal to the time resolution,

\begin{equation}
d = = 15 m
\label{eq:requiredDist}
\end{equation}

The room is too small for this flight path; the largest it can accomodate is 14.6 m, so cleanly separating the ground state from the first excited state will not be possible in 76,74Ge.

The absolute cross section is the number of times a reaction occurred normalized by the total number of particles incident on the target and the number density of nuclei in the target:

\begin{equation}
cross section = times reaction occurred / (particles incident on target * number density of target nuclei)

cross section = \frac{times reaction occurred}{particle current * time * target thickness}
\label{eq:cross_section}
\end{equation}

How many reactions occured and the target thickness do not affect the setup of the detector.  Calculating the number of reactions requires the efficiency of the detector.  Chapter ?? examines this carefully.  The efficiency is approximately 3\% for all bars.  The target thickness is well-known from RBS measurements; the results are summarized in Chapter ?? and a description of the analysis is in Appendix ??.  Maintaining good energy resolution does dictate a target choice, however.  Because the \Ge{76} targets are too thin to be self-supporting, they are backed by a gold foil.  The target is positioned so that the first material the beam encounters is Ge.  Resulting neutrons can pass through the gold without the energy straggling that would afflict the \He{3} were it to pass through the gold.

The need for accurate time and particle current both affect the experimental setup.  The DAQ provides a 100 Hz NIM logic pulse, providing a measure of time.  But the DAQ cannot collect new events while it is processing an event.  A measure of the time experienced by the DAQ is the appropriate time to use when calculating the cross section.  In addition to a 100 Hz signal, the DAQ also provides a NIM logic pulse that is low when the DAQ is busy.  Vetoing the timing signal with this busy signal gives the live time needed for the cross section calculation.  The schematic is shown in figure ??.

There are several ways to record information about the particle current.  The most reliable is to measure RBS from the gold backing with a Silicon detector.  Because the 26Mg target is self-supporting, it is necessary to record other measures, such as the charge collected on the beamstop and the gamma reaction to a small NaI2 crystal, both of which show a linear relationship with the beam current within statistical error.

\subsection{Testing with 26Mg}
Show results from first run and look at timing - hey it's all right!
Look at background - will need to improve

76,74Ge cross-sections are predicted to be 300 mb, much lower than previous cross-sections measured with the neutron wall.  26Mg has a cross-section of ?? mb and its differential cross-section (right word?) has been well measured by ?? [CITE!].  Since its level structure is similar to 76,74Ge in that is has a low-lying 0+ first excited state, 26Mg(\He{3},n) serves as an excellent system to test the neutron wall.

% figure: 26Mg level scheme (along with Ge level scheme?)

The TOF spectrum at the forwardmost angle is shown in Figure ??.  The neutron peak has a width of 1.? ns and is clearly visible against the background.  Figure ?? shows the agreement of the extracted cross-section to previously measured data.

% figure: Bar A TOF spectrum

% figure: 26Mg cross-section compared to old data

The concerning thing about this data is that the neutron peaks at angles with low cross-sections do not stand significantly above the random background.  This has serious implications for the 76,74Ge experiment, where the cross-section is suspected to be even lower.  Current data on two-proton transfer typically has errors no worse than 20\%; to achieve such errors it is necessary to either reduce the background or increase the beam current.  Increasing the beam current substantially was not feasable because of ion source limitations.  The background comes primarily from low-energy gamma radiation from the cement in the room and from muons produced by cosmic rays.  The next chapter discusses the construction of a cosmic-ray veto.
