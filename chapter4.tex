\section{Testing with \MgReaction}
\begin{comment}
Show results from first run and look at timing - hey it's all right!
Look at background - will need to improve
\end{comment}

\GeTargets cross-sections are predicted to be much lower than previous cross-sections measured with the neutron wall.  A good candidate for testing the operation of the neutron wall is \MgReaction, which has a reasonably high cross section, on the order of 1~mb/sr, for 16~MeV \He{3} beam and has neutron kinematics similar to \reaction.  The differential cross-section of \MgReaction has been measured at several energies bracketing 16~MeV by \cite{Bohne_Mg}, which makes the \MgReaction an important check on the \reaction absolute cross section.  

Data on \MgReaction was taken with the neutron detector set up as described in {\chap}~\ref{chap:2pExpt} with a beam energy of 16~MeV and a 1.94~mg/cm$^2$ thick \Mg{26} target.  The typical beam current was 20~nA. The TOF spectrum at the forwardmost angle, 6$^{\circ}$, is shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:MgTOF}.  The neutron peak has a width of 1.2~ns and is clearly visible over the background.

The concerning thing about these data is that the high background rate severely limits sensitivity.  This has serious implications for the \GeTargets experiment, where DWBA calculations predict the cross sections to be about a factor of three lower than those for the \Mg{26} target.  Further lowering the event rate, the \GeTargets target must be thinner than the \Mg{26} target to optimize the energy resolution.  Achieving sufficient precision on the ground-state cross section requires either reducing the background or increasing the beam current.  The latter was not feasible because of ion source limitations.  The background comes primarily from low-energy $\gamma$ radiation from the room and from muons produced by cosmic rays.  Neither vetoing nor shielding against $\gamma$-radiation would be effective since materials with high $\gamma$ interaction rates would also scatter incoming neutrons.  The muons, however, are charged and can be readily identified with additional plastic scintillator.  We therefore seek to reduce the muon component of the random background using a veto shield that registers the likely presence of a muon.  The events identified as muon events can then be discarded.  

Identifying muons using additional scintillator material is possible because of how cosmic-ray induced muons deposit energy.  The majority of muons traveling through the detector are Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIP's), which means that their energy loss is proportional to their path length in that material.  An effective design for a muon veto, then, is to cover the neutron detector with independent plastic scintillator detectors.  Signals in the neutron detector that are in coincidence with a signal in the ``sheilding'' detector are likely to be muon events.  While the charged muon will trigger both detectors every time its path through the scintillator is long enough to deposit energy above the detector threshold, the neutron is highly unlikely to interact in both detectors.  The bars of the neutron detector are 5 cm thick; the chance of detecting a 20 MeV neutron with a typical threshold is 10\%, making the chance of a neutron interacting in two such bars only 1\%.  The veto material available, donated from an inactive experiment by the University of Michigan, is only 1~cm thick, dropping the probability of a detectable neutron interaction in to $\sim$0.02\%.  By placing the available scintillator over the neutron detector bar, it is possible to identify muons to an accuracy of at least 99\%.  Note that such a veto does not identify $\gamma$ radiation because its efficiency is similar to neutrons in the scintillating plastic.

\end{comment}
The scintillator bars of the neutron detector are outfitted with two PMT's, each coupled to its end via a non-scintillating light guide.  Having two PMT's is essential both for good timing information and also to lessen the position sensitivity of the signal.  Instrumenting the veto scintillators in this way was not feasible.  Fitting a top and bottom PMT to each veto bar would require 32 PMT's and lightguides, along with independent power supplies for each.  Instead, wavelength-shifting fiber (WLS) was chosen to collect the light.

WLS collects light by absorbing broad-spectrum radiation and re-emitting that light in the green.  It is possible to coat the fiber with material having an index of refraction that guarantees total internal reflection for green light, and so the light bounces in the fiber until it reaches a detector.  WLS largely eliminates position sensitivity because it can be arranged on the detector so that no section of scintillator is more than 5~cm distant from the collecting fiber [cite??].  Because the fiber is fairly flexible, its pattern on the detector can be designed so that the fiber exits the plastic in a single bundle, allowing instrumentation with only one PMT.

Possible disadvantages to WLS are signal intensity [cite??] and fragility of the fiber.  Collecting sufficient light to boost the signal above the noise is a serious concern, and can be overcome by using many WLS strands to collect light [cite NASA].  The fragility of the WLS is more difficult to remedy.  To maximize light collection, the fiber on the detector should be taken directly to the PMT, which should be as close to the plastic as possible to minimize signal attenuation.  In some designs [CITE!], this is achieved by enclosing the fiber run to the PMT in a stiff cast.  The design for the neutron wall needed flexibility in PMT placement, making a fixed support between the detector and PMT impractical.  Several attempts were made to run the WLS collection fiber directly from the scintillator to the PMT, but even with careful handling, the fiber quickly degraded and eventually snapped.  Such degradation would have left no way to access the veto signals and was unacceptable.  The decision was made to sever the WLS at the end of the plastic and make a robust cable to attach to the WLS and carry the signal to the PMT.  While severing the WLS causes significant light loss, it ensures durability.  The details of this design are discussed in the next section.

\end{comment}

The main components of a veto paddle are the scintillator, which generates light in response to energy deposition, the WLS, which collects the light, the endpiece that is glued onto the scintillator, which fixes the position of the WLS exiting the scintillator, and the cable, which connects to the WLS and carries the signal to the PMT.  Each piece is discussed in this section.

The scintillator material itself has a thickness of 1~cm, five times thinner than the bars of the neutron detector.  1~cm thick veto material is desirable in order to minimize interaction of the neutrons with material other than the neutron detector bars, but is thick enough to efficiently detect muons.  The material is 17~cm wide and was cut to a length of 160~cm, allowing the veto paddle to slightly overhang a neutron detector bar.  The material had been stored in a warehouse with no temperature control for several years, and some of the material was under mechanical strain during its storage.  While some of the material was clear plastic that readily responded to ultraviolet light and had a smooth, uncrazed surface, some of the material was badly damaged.  Some of the material had developed internal cracks, creating mirror-like surfaces within the scintillator.  Much of the material suffered from damage to the surface such as crazing.  It was expected that the damaged bars would suffer from poor efficiency, but instead they functioned as well as paddles made of pristine material.  The tests on efficiency are discussed later, in {\sect}~\ref{sec:singleVeto}.

The design goal for the veto paddles was to maximize light collection while ensuring durability.  One way to increase light collection is to use a fiber path that allows both ends of the fiber to terminate at the PMT.  Light absorbed by the fiber propagates in both directions along the fiber axis; if one end of the fiber terminates, the light must reflect from that surface and travel back to the PMT.  In this case, light loss occurs due to reflection at the terminating surface as well as attenuation along the path.  Light loss at the terminating surface can be lessened somewhat with the application of reflective paint [CITE] and more so by silvering the surface [CITE], but a simpler method of recovering the light is to loop the fiber on the scintillator as shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:paddle}, which allows collection of light regardless of its travel direction.  To further increase light collection, four fibers follow the fiber path, two on each side of the paddle.  The arrangement is shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:paddleXsection}.  To ensure the durability of the veto paddle, the fibers are glued into channel machined into the scintillator to protect it from strain during handling.  Additionally, the bend radius chosen was ?? cm, which seemed to have no adverse effect on the WLS.
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/veto_end.eps}
\caption{The WLS is glued to the scintillator in a ``U'' shape to maximize light recovery.}
\label{fig:paddle}
\end{figure}

An endcap fitted to the scintillator helps protect the WLS and also fixes its location, allowing good alignment to the fibers in the cable.  The endcap also minimizes possible WLS flexing by connecting to machined indents in the scintillator with a press fit.  Because the endcap extends into the scintillator, bending of the fiber perpendicular to its axis is essentially eliminated.  Scintillator material is also machined away from the fiber entrance to the endcap to avoid point pressure.  This ``ramping'' can be shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:paddleAssembly}.  Once the endcap is slid onto the scintillator, it is glued in place.  This glue is needed because holes the WLS fiber travels through have a small clearance so that threading the endcap does not strip the cladding from the WLS fiber or otherwise damage it, which means that the fibers are slightly loose in their housing.  To optimize light transmission from the WLS fibers to the cable fiber, the surface is polished with a bull-nose, single-crystal diamond.  Gluing the fibers secures them in place so that this polishing does not damage the fiber.  
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/veto_assembly.eps}
\caption{The endcap is glued to the scintillator after it is slid into place to secure the WLS fibers.}
\label{fig:paddleAssembly}
\end{figure}

The cable consists of two groups of four-clusters of optical fiber, one group for each of the four-clusters of WLS fiber exiting the scintillator.  Optical fiber is preferable to WLS fiber because it is optimized for transmission and is also more durable.  The cable housing must ensure that each transmission fiber completely overlap its WLS fiber and also that the fiber is protected from damage en route to the PMT.  To accomplish this, the cable consists of two types of connectors, one that mates with the endcap attached to the scintillator and another that connects to the PMT, each connected by slightly stiff tubing (durometer = ??) that encases the 2~m long optical fibers.  This tubing helps protect the optical fiber by limiting its bend radius.  At each interface between tubing and connector, the primary concern is that the stresses on the transmission fiber be small enough to avoid damaging the fiber.  A hose barb attached to each connector allows the transmission fiber through and also allows the tubing to firmly connect without putting strain on the fiber.  A cable is shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:paddleCable}.  Each cable has two groups of optical fiber that connect separately to a cap on the PMT.  Each PMT cap can accept four independent cable connections, allowing two veto paddles to be instrumented by one PMT.  All materials used are black delrin, which is an opaque plastic that is stiff enough to be suitable for machining and also contributes to the light-tightness of the cable.  
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/paddle_connector.eps}
\caption{The cable connector must align with the WLS on the endcap.}
\label{fig:paddleCable}
\end{figure}

The primary design constraint for the portion of the cable that attaches to the endcap is that each transmission fiber completely overlap its WLS fiber.  The diameter of the transmission fiber is 1.2~mm, larger than the 1~mm-diameter WLS fiber, which allows misalignment up to 0.1~mm without greatly impacting light collection.  Tight-fitting dowels help align the region of the cables containing the fiber cluster.  This is particularly important because the connectors are machined from plastic and are not perfectly square - some connectors bow as much as 0.5~mm from normal.  The only regions that must be carefully aligned, however, are the fiber clusters, and the dowels ensure accurate alignment.  Like the WLS fibers in the endcap, the optical fibers must be glued in place so that the mating surface can be diamond-polished without damage.  

The connector that terminates at the PMT is cylindrical to make machining of the PMT cap simple.  In contrast to the endcap connector, the PMT connector has minimal constraints on the position of the optical fibers because the entire 5~cm-diameter PMT face is sensitive to light.  The end of the PMT connector, like the endcap and the endcap connector, is diamond-polished to maximize optical coupling, and so the fiber is glued into place to protect it from damage during polishing.    Also like the endcap connector, strain relief is provided to the optical cable by attaching the protective tubing to the connector with hose barb, eliminating extreme bending of the optical cable.    
The cap fitted to the face of the PMT has four holes drilled with a diameter that provides a press-fit with the PMT connectors from the cable.  The cap fits snugly onto the PMT so that the optical cables in the PMT connectors are held securely to the surface of the PMT.  The diamond polishing results in a very uniform surface and it was found that applying optical grease to the connection did not result in noticeable improvement.  The coupling to the PMT was therefore left as an air coupling.  One way to improve light collection by the PMT was to connect the optical fibers to PMT closer to the center of the PMT face.  This was done by machining PMT caps with the holes for the connectors drilled as closely as allowed by the plastic, $\sim$2~mm.

%\subsection{tests on intrinsic efficiency}
\begin{comment}
Show signal from detector
Talk about first tests?  Can talk about sensitivity to geometric alignment of trigger paddles ...
Maybe mention this and then be like, ``this is why we decided to look at the efficiency this other way that was less sensitive''
except you weren't able to do further tests so you'll just have to say the limits you got
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/PulseChan_1_4.eps}
\caption{Pulses from muons in the veto paddles.}
\label{fig:vetoSignal}
\end{figure}
\end{comment}
The intrinsic efficiency of the paddles can be tested by requiring a coincidence with several paddles.  The several-detector coincidence identifies signals as muons.  If the coincidence paddles are arranged so that the path of any muon intersecting all the veto paddles must also intersect the volume of the veto paddle, the efficiency measured is the veto's intrinsic efficiency, separated from its geometric coverage of whatever detector it is vetoing.

In practice, arranging the available scintillator to force muons through the test volume was difficult because the available scintillator was instrumented with bulky lightguides and could not be laid directly on the test volume.  A simple cosmic ray simulation program helped determine an arrangement that maximized geometrical efficiency.  This arrangement, however, was extremely sensitive to placement; measured efficiency of the same bar could change from 98\% to 75\% with a displacement of a few centimeters.
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textheigt]{figures/veto_test_layout.eps}
\caption{This arrangement of coincidence material ensures that muons triggering all coincidence detectors must also travel through the veto paddle.  The coincidence material is drawn in red while the veto paddle is in blue.}
\label{fig:efficiencyTest}
\end{figure}

The efficiency was measured by counting how often the veto paddle had a detectable signal when all the coincidence material registered a coincidence.  Assuming the muon was constrained to travel through the veto paddle volume, the ratio gives the efficiency.  The DAQ Event signal was a logic pulse resulting from the coincidence of the coincidence paddles.  This logic pulse also acted as a start for a TAC.  The TAC stop signal was a delayed, discriminated veto paddle signal.  The outgoing TAC signal was sent to an analog to digital converter (ADC) for integration.  Signals from the veto paddle coincident with the other scintillators show up in the timing spectrum as a peak at the time of the delay.  The integral of this timing peak divided by the number of event triggers gives the efficiency.

\label{fig:vetoTestElectronics}
\end{figure}

Testing the efficiency of the veto paddle with this setup was not ideal because the geometrical efficiency was very sensitive to the placement of the coincidence detectors; measured efficiency of the same bar could change from 98\% to 75\% when one of the coincidence detectors was shifted by as little as a few centimeters.  However, this setup was useful in testing the effect of the cable polishing, cable out-of-true-ness, and the condition of the plastic scintillator.  In general, all efficiency measurements fell between 94\% and 98\%: even the veto paddles made of the most badly damaged plastic were as efficient as the veto paddles made from the plastic in excellent condition.  No statistically significant differences were seen between cables with the most and the least amount of bowing.  Polishing the cables with the bull-nose single-crystal diamond increases detection efficiency by $\sim2$\%, although it should be noted that the change may have been due to correlated noise in the system rather than to improved light transmission.  The discriminator threshold, set to its lowest value, gave an efficiency of 98\% compared to 94\% when set to its highest value.

Testing the position dependence of the efficiency using the setup described above was not practical due to its sensitivity on positioning.  Instead, the response of the veto paddles to a loosely collimated $\gamma$ source was tested.  Counting detected $\gamma$ radiation showed a deviation of less than 8.5\% over the veto paddle.  While this is not a measurement of the position dependence of the muon efficiency, it does limit the efficiency change over the paddle since muons typically deposit at least double the energy of the $\gamma$ radiation from the $^{60}$Co source.  See {\fig}~\ref{fig:positionDependence} for the variation of the efficiencies.

\subsection{On-Detector Efficiency}
\begin{comment}
Initial efficiency - would be nice to show this data
Describe different cosmics that hit the neutron bar but miss the veto - argh!
Discuss changes made to mounting to improve coverage - show new data (cosmics)
\end{comment}
Sixteen veto paddles were initially mounted on top of the neutron detector support structure to avoid removing (and potentially damaging) the heavy neutron detectors.  Each veto paddle was $\sim$2~cm offset from a bar in the neutron detector.  Running a test with \MgReaction showed good cosmic rejection in the two innermost bars of each four-bar unit and worse rejection in the outer two bars by about 20\%, corresponding to double the cosmic background.  The outer bars act as additional veto for the inner bars, while the outer bars enjoy no such additional vetoing.  
\begin{figure}[htp]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/initialBackground.eps}
\vspace{3in}
\caption{Room background after rejection with the initial placement of the veto paddles.  Note that the high-background bars are those on the ends of each group of four.}
\label{fig:initialBackground}
\end{figure}

A simulation of the cosmic background indicated that the geometrical efficiency was very sensitive to the distance between the veto paddle and neutron detector bar as well as the distance between the bars of the neutron detector.   The bars in the neutron detector were moved as close as the mounting screws would allow, within 1~cm.  Instead of attaching the veto paddles on top of the retaining bars on the neutron detector, they were taped to the bars and both bar and veto paddle were supported together by the same retaining bar.  The separation between the bars of the neutron detector and their veto paddle is $\sim$0.5~cm due to stiff foam placed between the two to protect the WLS channels in the veto paddles.  Material was also added to the sides of the outermost neutron detectors.  The final setup is shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:vetoSetup}.  These changes improved both the average and uniformity of the background rejection, as can be seen in {\fig}~\ref{fig:finalBackground}.

\section{Electronics}
\begin{comment}
Originally wanted to use timing information but there weren't enough channels
Bit Register - give example
discuss random rate and estimate how often you'll fire during a real event and also how often one bar will fire with something real, vetoing a real event
LeCroy 4532 - MALU - majority logic unit ``The status of up to 32 inputs can be monitored and recorded by issuing a strobe.  Since the inputs are edge-triggered, the strobe may be a gate of arbitrary duration.  Then any inputs which are on during any portion of the gate are recorded and stored in a pattern register.'' (from the manual).
\end{comment}
As mentioned above in {\sect}~\ref{sec:singleVeto}, tests on single veto paddles were done using a timing spectrum.  Recording time information for the full veto was not practical, and two bit registers were used instead.  A bit register has several inputs, each corresponding to a bit in an integer, and a gate.  When the gate is high, the bit register records the bit pattern built by the voltages on its inputs; its output is the integer corresponding to this bit pattern.  This integer is a unique representation of which bars fired during the time specified by the gate.  If the gate used is the Event signal from the neutron detector, the bit register will record which veto paddles fired during an event of interest.  Two 16-channel LeCroy 4532 bit registers were able to instrument all the veto paddles.  The gate signal was a 200~ns-wide copy of the event trigger.

Recording the integer generated by the bit register instead of the time of the signal relative to the beam bunch is a loss of information.  The maximum time difference between an event in the neutron detector and an event in the veto that will still be recorded in the bit pattern is the width of the gate signal, 200 ns.  This compares unfavorably to the timing spectrum, where even with a leading edge discriminator, the timing peak has a width of less than 5 ns.  The concern is that this loss of precision in timing information will lead to unacceptable vetoing of real events.  

Several sources contribute to non-beam-related background radiation, resulting in a beam-off rate in a neutron detector bar of $\sim$1000~Hz.  While some of these events are due to muons, but they have a rate of 1~Hz/ft$^2$ and are therefore a small part of the beam-off noise rate.  The beam-off rate, then, serves as a suitable rate with which to calculate an upper bound for the rejection of beam-related events.  The probability that a noise event will occur within the window allowed by the bit register and veto a beam-related event is
\begin{equation}
\text{P(A)}\times\text{P(B)} = \text{R}_{\text{n}}\tau_{\text{bit reg.}}\times\text{R}_{\text{beam}}\tau_{\text{beam}},
\end{equation}
where A is a noise event recording in the bit register and B is a beam-related event that has triggered the DAQ.  The probability of a veto scales with the noise rate $\text{R}_{\text{n}}$ and beam-related event rate $\text{R}_{\text{beam}}$ as well as the time window of the bit register $\tau_{\text{bit reg.}}$ and DAQ event $\tau_{\text{beam}}$.  With a noise rate of 1000 Hz, a bit register window of 200 ns, and an event window of 1000 ns, the probability of the a vetoed beam-related event is $2\times10^{-10}\text{R}_{\text{beam}}$.  This fraction of vetoed events is less than 1\% and will not have any statistical significance, even with the timing resolution lost by moving to a bit register.  A schematic of the veto electronics is shown in {\fig}~\ref{fig:vetoElectronics}.  Note that no changes to the DAQ other than the addition of the bit register are required.

\section{Beam Tests}
\begin{comment}
What data should I show?  Old Mg vs. New Mg?  Or New Mg with no veto vs.  New Mg with veto?
show the vetoed spectrum - put a limit on how much real signal is rejected?
\end{comment}
The background rejection of the assembled veto system is approximately 90\% as can be seen in {\fig}~\ref{fig:veto_26Mg}.  The rejection is strongly dependent on energy cuts placed on data; with lower energy cuts, gamma radiation contributes significantly to the background, and the veto is not effective.  90\% rejection is typical of cuts that are above the thorium edge.  Although such a high bound on the energy discards many neutron events, it also rejects more of the background $\gamma$ radiation and maximizes the signal/background ratio.See figure ?? for a description of the rejection as a function of the energy cut. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/veto_26Mg.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:vetoData}The effect of the veto on the $^{26}$Mg($^3$He,n) data.}
\label{fig:veto_26Mg}
\end{figure}

The reduced background significantly improves the data we were able to obtain on \MgReaction.  Errors on the ground state transition were reduced from 7\% to 3\%.  Most importantly, the signal strength that we now have 2$\sigma$ sensitivity to when running at a beam current of ?? for one week is ??, down from ??.  This is crucial for investigating the distribution of the \zp state in \GeTargets.

\subsection{Rejected Signal}
\begin{comment}
Two causes for rejected signal
1. the bars are ganged together; could get a signal in one veto bar that does not mean there was a cosmic in its adjacent neutron detector
2. randoms

can place a limit on randoms, reals, and therefore good rejected signal
\end{comment}
While the achieved background rejection is excellent, it is important to consider how often the veto rejects real neutron events.  Such a rejection could occur when a neutron interacts in both the veto and the neutron detector, when the neutron detector sees a real signal and the veto triggers from an uncorrelated event such as a background gamma, or when a neutron interacting in the detector kicks out a proton that triggers the veto.  This last case should occur very rarely; this is the primary reason we chose to mount the veto on the front of the detector.  It is also possible for the veto to absorb a neutron that could otherwise interact in the detector.  In all cases, the vetoing of real events will result in timing peaks that sit on top of the flat, random background of the rejected events.  {\fig}~\ref{fig:rejectionTOF} shows the rejected events for all current \Mg{26} data; no peak is visible.  Given the background, this places a limit on the total rejection of real neutron events at ?? at a 90\% confidence level.  
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/26Mg_rejection.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:rejection}A plot of the rejected events.  Peaks in the rejected spectrum are from real, vetoed events.  No neutron peak is visible; there is a small peak from rejected gamma events.}
\label{fig:rejectionTOF}
\end{figure}

Testing with \MgReaction demonstrates that the muon veto reduces background by $\sim$90\% and does not veto a significant number of beam-related events.  In addition to verifying the proper functioning of the veto system, this reaction also measures the efficiency of the neutron detector because the cross-section is well known.  These efficiency calculations, as well as the data from the \GeTargets experiments, will be discussed in the next chapter.
